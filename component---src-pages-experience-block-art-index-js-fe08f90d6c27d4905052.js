Each block in the chain adds/removes visual elements on a canvas that represents the artwork. The blockchain network is built to support thousands of nodes and uses a flooding protocol to disseminate operations on visual elements and generated blocks. Applications can interact with the blockchain and participate in an art project instance by using an API called blockedartlib that we built. The system validates authenticity of operations and uses a proof of work algorithm to guarantee fairness. The BlockArt system was deployed on the Azure cloud. This project was completed by a team of 4 software engineering students including me, I worked on the main blockchain miner logic while my teammates worked on the geometric intersection, UI, and art nodes logic."),o.a.createElement("img",{src:l.a,alt:"block art flow diagram"}))};t.default=function(){return o.a.createElement(r.a,null,o.a.createElement(c.a,{title:"Blockchain Art"}),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"container"},s()))}}}]);
